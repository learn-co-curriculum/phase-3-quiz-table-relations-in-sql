# SQL: Foreign Keys

I want to establish a relationship between a `genres` table and a `books` table.
What kind of key would I need to add to the `books` table to establish this
relationship?

## Correct

Foreign Key

> Exactly! The foreign key refers to the primary key in another table.

## Incorrect

Primary Key

> Not quite. The primary key refers to the row in the current table. Which key
> refers to a different table?

## Incorrect

Integer Key

> Not quite. It's likely that the key will be an integer, but that's not the
> correct name.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
