# SQL: Joins

We have two tables: dogs and owners. All of the owners have dogs, but not all dogs belong to an owner - some are strays. Which query will return ALL of the dogs and their matching owners?

## Correct

```
SELECT * FROM Dogs
LEFT OUTER JOIN Owners on Dogs.owner_id = Owners.id;
```

> Correct! Dogs is the left table, so all of the dogs will be returned, even if
> they don't have an owner. Matching owners will also be returned.

## Incorrect

```
SELECT * FROM Owners
LEFT OUTER JOIN Dogs on Dogs.owner_id = Owners.id;
```

> Not quite. This will actually return all of the owners and their matching dogs.
> Which query will give us every dog?

## Incorrect

```
SELECT * FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Owners on Dogs.owner_id = Owners.id;
```

> Not quite. This will actually only return dogs that have an owner. Which query
> will give us every dog?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
