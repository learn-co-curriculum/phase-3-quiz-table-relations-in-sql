# Question

Our database has two tables: cocktails and restaurants. The same cocktail can be served by many restaurants, and each restaurant serves many different cocktails. How can we relate cocktails to restaurants?

## Correct

Create a join table where each row relates a cocktail with a restaurant

> Perfect! This is a many-to-many relationship, so we need a join table that has
> cocktail\_id and restaurant\_id columns.

## Incorrect

Add a cocktail\_id column (foreign key) to the restaurants table

> Not quite. This would allow restaurants to serve only a single cocktail. A
> restaurant would belong to a cocktail.

## Incorrect

Add a restaurant\_id column (foreign key) to the cocktails table

> Not quite. This would mean each cocktail could be served at only one restaurant.
> A cocktail would belong to a restaurant.

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
