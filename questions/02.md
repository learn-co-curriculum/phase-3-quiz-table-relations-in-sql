# SQL: Foreign Keys

We have two tables: `users` and `posts`. A user has many posts, and a post
belongs to a user. To create this relationship, you would add the foreign key to
the `users` table.

## Incorrect

True

> Remember, in a one-to-many association, the foreign key should be on the table
> of the record that **belongs to** a record in the other table, in this case
> posts.

## Correct

False

> Correct! In a one-to-many association, the foreign key should be on the table
> of the record that **belongs to** a record in the other table, in this case
> posts.
